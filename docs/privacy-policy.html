    <h1>Shield VPN Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-09-15</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Shield VPN ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not log or inspect the content of your VPN traffic.</li>
      <li>We collect minimal diagnostics and advertising data to operate, secure, and improve the App.</li>
      <li>Third-party SDKs (Google Mobile Ads, Firebase/Google services) may receive device and advertising identifiers.</li>
      <li>You can opt out of personalized ads via your device advertising settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1) Account and Authentication</h3>
    <p>The App does not require user registration or collect names, emails, or passwords for general use. For VPN service authentication, the App uses service credentials provided by the app or the selected server configuration. These are not your personal credentials.</p>

    <h3>2) VPN Usage and Connection Metadata</h3>
    <p>We do not log browsing history, DNS queries, traffic destination, or data content. To operate the VPN and show connection statistics locally, the App may process transient metrics on your device (e.g., bytes sent/received, session duration, connection stage). These metrics are not transmitted to our servers.</p>

    <h3>3) Device and Diagnostics</h3>
    <p>Device information (e.g., device model, OS version, app version), crash logs, and performance diagnostics may be collected via platform services to improve stability. Approximate location may be inferred by third-party SDKs (e.g., for ad serving) based on IP or device signals, subject to their policies and your device settings.</p>

    <h3>4) Advertising and Analytics</h3>
    <p>The App uses Google Mobile Ads to display banner and interstitial test ads (or production ads once configured). Google may collect identifiers (such as Advertising ID), and telemetry necessary to provide ads. See Google’s privacy policy. We do not combine ad data with VPN traffic data.</p>

    <h3>5) Permissions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>VPN permission: required to establish a VPN tunnel.</li>
      <li>Network access: required to connect to servers and load content.</li>
      <li>Notifications (optional): to inform about connection status or important updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain VPN connectivity.</li>
      <li>Improve app performance and reliability.</li>
      <li>Display and measure advertising where applicable.</li>
      <li>Detect and prevent abuse or misuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not retain logs of your browsing activity or traffic contents.</li>
      <li>Local statistics (e.g., last connection state, selected server) are stored on-device and can be cleared by uninstalling the App or clearing app data.</li>
      <li>Crash logs and diagnostic data collected by third-party services are retained per their policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited data with service providers that help us operate the App (e.g., Google for ads, analytics, and Firebase services), strictly for the purposes described in this policy. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, property, or safety.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us information, contact us to remove it.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Opt out of personalized advertising in your device settings (Android: Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization).</li>
      <li>Disable notifications via system settings.</li>
      <li>Stop all collection by uninstalling the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location and the services used, data processed by third-party providers may be transferred to other countries with different data protection laws.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect data. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Mobile Ads & AdMob Policy</a></li>
